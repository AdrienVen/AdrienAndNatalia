This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) created with the help of the [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) command.

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the login page.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) have yet to be implemented, as such the login page does not connect to the backend just yet.
